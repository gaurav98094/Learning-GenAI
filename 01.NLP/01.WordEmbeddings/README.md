### What is word embedding?
Word embedding or word vector is an approach with which we represent documents and words. It is defined as a numeric vector input that allows words with similar meanings to have the same representation. It can approximate meaning and represent a word in a lower dimensional space. These can be trained much faster than the hand-built models that use graph embeddings like WordNet.

For instance, a word embedding with 50 values holds the capability of representing 50 unique features. Many people choose pre-trained word embedding models like Flair, fastText, SpaCy, and others.

### The problem
Given a supervised learning task to predict which tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not (classification). Here the independent variable would be the tweets (text) and the target variable would be the binary values (1: Real Disaster, 0: Not real Disaster).

Now, Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms only take numeric input. So, how do we convert tweets to their numeric values? We will dive deep into the techniques to solve such problems, but first letâ€™s look at the solution provided by word embedding.

### The solution
Word Embeddings in NLP is a technique where individual words are represented as real-valued vectors in a lower-dimensional space and captures inter-word semantics. Each word is represented by a real-valued vector with tens or hundreds of dimensions.
